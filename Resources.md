# Resources for HillTau

The HillTau reference paper will shortly be out. Please cite the reference
paper if you use HillTau

HillTau works with the FindSim project (https://findsim.ncbs.res.in/)

Specifically, HillTau can be used as an alternative simulator to MOOSE
for developing reduced versions of signaling pathway models.
Because of its efficiency, HillTau is a very good way to perform initial
model development and optimization when matching against experimental data.
This process is described in the upcoming paper on HOSS, Hierarchical 
Optimization of Systems Simulations.

The MOOSE simulator (https://moose.ncbs.res.in/) 
(Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) 
is used extensively in these examples as the more detailed mass-action 
reference against which most of the HillTau models are compared.
